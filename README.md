# Regression-Model-to-Predict-Cement-Compressive-Strength
 
This is my final project internship at YBI Foundation<br>
The project is a Machine Learning project using Python and its various libraries<br>
The goal of the project is to find the strength of cement at day 7 to day 28<br>
My model is showing <b>89.08%</b> accuracy<br>
