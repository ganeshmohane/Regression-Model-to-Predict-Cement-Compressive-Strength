# Regression-Model-to-Predict-Cement-Compressive-Strength

 This is my final project intership at YBI foundation. This is Machine Learning Project.
 In which i have used python and its various liabraries for modeling.
        In this project we have to find strength of the cement at the day 7 to day 28. we have given the data, using that data we have to find good model with <b>89.08%</b> accuracy.
